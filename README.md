This site is designed to showcase **my best-loved projects** in web development.

It is built with **React** and **Express**.  I wanted to take a content management approach similar to **Jekyll** (a blog-aware, static site generator).  I decided to use a predictable file structure and write my pages in **MarkDown**, which I have enjoyed using in sites like StackOverflow and GitHub.
