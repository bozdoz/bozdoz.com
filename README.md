This site is designed to showcase **my best-loved projects** in web development.

This is a **Universal JavaScript** app: The pages are generated server-side through **Express** with the help of **React Router**; the layout is created with **React** (*of course*), and most of the content is in a simple **MarkDown** and **FrontMatter** format.

### Nice-to-haves (someday):

- Use GraphQL to link project tags and create a tag page 
- Blog structure
- GitHub webhooks
- Change PlainPage; Simplify FrontMatter to Page.js and use more
- Try sharing some of the content of LoadingPage and PageLayout
