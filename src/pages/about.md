This site is designed to showcase **[my best-loved projects](/projects)** in web development.

It is built with **React** and **Express**. I wanted to take a content management approach similar to **Jekyll** (a blog-aware, static site generator): I decided to use a predictable file structure and write my pages in **MarkDown**.

What I've loved about **React** is how modular/reusable it is; and what I've loved about **MarkDown** is how minimalist it is. I wished for a simple implementation of both languages, but generally found only a handful of examples which only dealt with _some_ of the issues.

This is a **Universal JavaScript** app: The pages are generated server-side through **Express** with the help of **React Router**; the layout is created with **React** (_of course_), and most of the content is in a simple **MarkDown** and **FrontMatter** format.

I've learned a lot through this project about both **React** and **Webpack**, and I've also had a lot of fun making it! I hope you enjoy the performance and experience of this site on the front end, especially as I continue to update.
