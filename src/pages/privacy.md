Any use of cookies by us will be solely for the purposes of improving the quality of access to the site by storing user preferences, and tracking user trends, such as how people use the site, and their site access preferences. Cookies tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to allow you to enter your login information less frequently. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the site and you may be required to reenter your password or login information more frequently.

All amended terms shall automatically be effective thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on the Site.
