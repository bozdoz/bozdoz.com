I am in the **[top 5% on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/488784/bozdoz)**, with most of that reputation coming from **JavaScript** questions and answers.

I've recently been digging into **React**/**Redux** projects, built in **Typescript**, and served in **Docker** containers.

In the last 10 years, I have helped build mapping applications in **Django** and **PostGIS** (e.g. [Alberta Tomorrow](/projects/alberta-tomorrow)), complete with **REST Frameworks** and mobile applications in **Cordova**. 

I have worked extensively with **[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)**, creating geospatial map plugins such as [<i class="fa fa-github"></i> WebGL Heatmap](https://github.com/ursudio/leaflet-webgl-heatmap), and [<i class="fa fa-github"></i> Freehand Shapes](https://github.com/bozdoz/leaflet-freehandshapes).

I have built several **WordPress** sites for clients, and have published a number of plugins, notably:

- [<i class="fa fa-wordpress"></i> Leaflet Map](https://wordpress.org/plugins/leaflet-map/), 
- [<i class="fa fa-wordpress"></i> Quote Tweet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/quote-tweet/), and 
- [<i class="fa fa-wordpress"></i> reCAPTCHA Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/recaptcha-jetpack/).

I developed a simple [typewriter simulator](/projects/typewrite-something) which has been widely used as an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.typewritesomething).

I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada with my partner, my son, and my dog.
