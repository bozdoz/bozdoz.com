I am in the **[top 6% on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/488784/bozdoz)**, with most of that reputation coming from **JavaScript** questions and answers.

I have played around extensively with **LeafletJS**, creating geospatial mapping application "plugins" such as **[WebGL Heatmap](https://github.com/ursudio/leaflet-webgl-heatmap)**, **[WordPress Leaflet Map](/projects/leaflet-map)**, and **[Freehand Shapes](https://github.com/bozdoz/leaflet-freehandshapes)**.

I built a small **[typewriter simulator](/projects/typewrite-something)** as a fun project.  It began as a [web app](http://typewritesomething.com), and I later made it into a [mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.typewritesomething).

I live in **Halifax, NS** with my partner and two dogs.
